# Analysis
1.  Configuration Structure:
	- The AppConfig struct ties all the configuration pieces together, including API server, webhook server, web client, remote server (online), and local state (offline).
	- Defaults are provided using Default trait implementations.
	
2.	load Method:
	- Tries to load a configuration file and falls back to defaults if the file doesnâ€™t exist or is invalid.
	- The defaults are saved to the configuration file if fallback occurs.
3.	save Method:
	- Saves the configuration to a TOML file with pretty formatting.
4.	Strengths:
	- Clear separation of concerns for different server configurations.
	- Defaults provided for all configurations.
	- Resilient loading mechanism with fallbacks.
5.	Improvement Areas:
	- Add validation for critical fields (e.g., port should be within valid ranges).
	- Improve error granularity when saving/loading files.
	- Test cases for edge scenarios (e.g., missing file, invalid file content).
